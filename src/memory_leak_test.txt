Relevant Code Snippet:
----------------------
GameController::~GameController() {
    delete boss;
    boss = nullptr;
}

switch (bossChoice) {
    case 1: boss = new Orge(); break;
    case 2: boss = new Phoenix(); break;
    case 3: boss = new Leviathan(); break;
    default: boss = new Orge(); break;
}

The leak:
105,280 bytes in 470 blocks are possibly lost

is coming from:
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLX_mesa.so.0.0.0

and indirectly from:
libsfml-window.so

This means the leak is inside SFML or the graphics driver (Mesa), not your own code. These are "possibly lost" blocks, which Valgrind flags when it can't determine if memory is still accessible â€” often due to complex internal structures in libraries like SFML or OpenGL.
